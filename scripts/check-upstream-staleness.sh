# Developer opt-in staleness check for the git-backed packages discovered by
# scripts/pkg-sources.sh (branch- and commit-pinned; tag-pinned are skipped).
#
# For each package it compares the current upstream branch/ref tip against the
# commit the latest published GitHub Release was actually built from. That
# commit is read from the release's <pkg>.built-sha asset, which build-deb.yml
# uploads alongside the .deb (written by record_upstream_sha at build time).
# When upstream has moved past the released commit, the package is STALE and
# needs a debian/changelog bump + rebuild.
#
# Exit status: 0 = all comparable packages current (WARN states — no release or
# no sidecar — are non-fatal); 2 = at least one STALE package (so this can gate
# an image release in CI); 1 = the script itself failed (missing tool, etc.).
#
# Run manually before cutting .deb releases, or as a CI pre-flight before
# building an image.
