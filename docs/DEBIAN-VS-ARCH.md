# Debian package build vs. pistomp-arch (Arch Linux) — known differences

## Background

pi-gen-pistomp migrates the pi-Stomp OS from Arch Linux ARM (pistomp-arch) to
Debian (Raspberry Pi OS Trixie). The motivation is platform stability: Arch's
rolling-release baseline breaks unpredictably for an appliance. Debian/RasPiOS
provides a stable, well-tested upstream with official RPi integration.

**Guiding principle:** the Arch build is the *runtime reference* — what the
device should look like and how it should behave. Debian is the *delivery
vehicle*. When something in Arch is "better," the goal is to port it, not
leave it behind.

This document records confirmed differences. "Intentional" means we understand
the divergence and it is correct. "Possible gap" means it may need to be
ported. "Road-mapped" means we know how to close the gap but haven't done it
yet.

## Fundamental build model difference

In Arch, the build chroot *is* the target system. All scripts run inside the
filesystem that becomes the final image via `arch-chroot`, so anything
installed during the build is automatically present at runtime.

In Debian there are three separate environments:

1. **Docker container** — the build host (native aarch64; no QEMU tax on
   Apple Silicon or aarch64 Linux). Tools installed here (e.g. `uv`, compiler
   toolchain) are available for building `.deb` packages but never reach the Pi.
2. **`.deb` build chroot** — a temporary environment `dpkg-buildpackage` uses
   to compile each package. Declared in `Build-Depends`; torn down after build.
3. **`ROOTFS_DIR`** — the target filesystem, built by pi-gen via debootstrap.
   Only things explicitly installed here (via `on_chroot`, `.deb` installs, or
   `install` calls in run scripts) reach the Pi.

## Build architecture

| | Debian (pi-gen-pistomp) | Arch (pistomp-arch) |
|---|---|---|
| Base system | Raspberry Pi OS Trixie (debootstrap via pi-gen) | Arch Linux ARM (pacstrap) |
| Build flow | pi-gen stages 0–2 inside Docker | 10 sequential `run_in_chroot` scripts |
| Kernel compilation | Native aarch64 (no QEMU on Apple Silicon / aarch64 Linux) | Native aarch64 inside chroot |
| Package format | `.deb` (dpkg/apt) | `.pkg.tar.zst` (pacman) |
| Final compression | xz (configurable: zip/gz/xz/none) | zstd -T0 -3 |

---

## uv availability

Both builds install uv via the official curl script to `/opt/pistomp/bin/uv`
with `INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1`. Debian also adds `/opt/pistomp/bin` to PATH
system-wide via `/etc/profile.d/pistomp.sh` (Arch does not). Systemd service
units that invoke uv directly should add `Environment=PATH=/opt/pistomp/bin:...`
explicitly — `profile.d` only affects login shells.

`uv` cannot be declared in Debian `Build-Depends` or `Depends` because it is
not a Debian package. The build-time copy lives only in the Docker image;
`05-run.sh` installs it into the target.

## jack2-pistomp

### waf invocation

Both builds apply the same two patches (`jack2-1.9.22-db-5.3.patch`,
`pi-controller-reset.patch`) and solve the same problem: the bundled waflib
uses the `imp` module removed in Python 3.12.

| | Arch | Debian |
|---|---|---|
| waflib source | System `waf` (bundled waflib deleted in `prepare()`) | Bundled `./waf` + `waflib-imp-to-types.patch` |
| Invocation | `waf configure && waf build` | `./waf configure && ./waf build` |
| PYTHONPATH | `export PYTHONPATH="${PWD}:${PYTHONPATH:-}"` (both build and install) | Not set — `./waf` finds its own tools |

### Debian-only patches

- `systemd-pkgconfig.patch` — fixes systemd.pc detection on Debian Trixie
- `systemd-unit-dir.patch` — provides a fallback unit dir when pkg-config returns nothing

---

## jack-capture

| | Arch | Debian |
|---|---|---|
| Base | `v0.9.73` tag | Post-0.9.73 master commit pinned via `JACK_CAPTURE_REF` |
| Post-release fixes | Applied via `jack_capture-post-release-fixes.patch` (29 commits) | Already included in the pinned commit — no patch needed |

---

## mod-ui — Python 3.11 isolation

Both builds use Python 3.11 for mod-ui (required by `tornado==4.3`, which is
incompatible with Python 3.13).

| | Arch | Debian |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3.11 source | Separate `pistomp-python311` package at `/opt/pistomp/python311/` | `uv python install 3.11` into uv's build cache |
| Venv creation | `uv venv --python /opt/pistomp/python311/bin/python3.11 --relocatable` | `uv python find 3.11 \| xargs python -m venv --copies` |
| Runtime dependency | `pistomp-python311` package must be installed | Python 3.11 binary is copied into the venv; no external dep |
| Dependency locking | `uv sync --frozen` against `uv.lock` | `pip install tornado==4.3` + `pip install <src>` (unlocked) |

**Road-mapped:** mod-ui's Debian build does not yet use a `uv.lock`. The path
to fix this:
1. Add `pyproject.toml` to the `TreeFallSound/mod-ui` fork declaring
   `tornado==4.3` and other direct deps, with `requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.12"`.
2. Run `uv lock` in that repo to generate `uv.lock`.
3. Change `debpkgs/mod-ui/debian/rules` to use `uv sync --frozen --no-dev
   --no-editable --project "$(MODUI_SRC_DIR)"` — identical pattern to pi-stomp.

---

## lg (lgpio) — Python module installation

Arch uses `setup.py install --root=...` (discovers site-packages at package
time). The Debian build installs the two files manually to avoid
`dh_usrlocal` rejecting files under `/usr/local/` and to sidestep the
`setup.py install` deprecation warning:

```
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/lgpio.py
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/_lgpio.so
```

---

## pi-stomp / pistomp-recovery — venv strategy

Both packages use `--system-site-packages` against `/usr/bin/python3` (system
Python 3.13). Because `/usr/bin/python3` exists on the target device,
`--copies` is not needed — the venv symlink is valid at runtime.

Arch uses `--relocatable`; Debian uses plain `uv venv` (relocation is not
required when the interpreter path is stable across build and target).

`uv sync` is called with `--no-editable` in both repos so the project wheel
lands in `site-packages` rather than as an editable `.pth` pointing to the
build tree. Both consume a pinned `uv.lock` from the source repo (`--frozen`).

## Python environment overview

| Component | Debian | Arch |
|---|---|---|
| System Python | 3.13 (`/usr/bin/python3`) | 3.13 (`/usr/bin/python`) |
| mod-ui | Python 3.11 copied into venv (via `--copies`) | Python 3.11 via `pistomp-python311` package |
| pi-stomp | System Python 3.13 venv + `--system-site-packages` | Same |
| pistomp-recovery | System Python 3.13 venv + `--system-site-packages` | Same |
| browsepy | `.deb` with venv | Venv created in 05-python.sh |
| touchosc2midi | `.deb` with venv | Venv created in 05-python.sh |
| System-wide pip installs | Yes — stage2/04-python installs ~10 packages globally via pip3 | No — all packages isolated to venvs |

**Possible gap:** Debian's `stage2/04-python` removes the `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`
marker and installs packages (pyserial, pycryptodomex, aggdraw, flask,
netifaces2, mido, docopt, pyliblo3, etc.) globally via `pip3`. Arch isolates
everything to venvs. The global installs are fragile (silently updated,
invisible to package management). Packages already declared in component
`pyproject.toml` files should be removed here; the remainder need to be
traced to their consumer and moved to the appropriate venv.

---

## systemd service enablement

Both repos use manual `ln -sf` symlinks into `wants/` directories rather than
`systemctl enable` or `deb-systemd-helper`. Debian's deb rules override
`dh_installsystemd` to prevent it from running.

### Service list differences

| Service | Debian | Arch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| rtirq | ✓ | — | Debian advantage |
| ttymidi | ✓ | — | Intentional: `dtoverlay=midi-uart0` is always present in `config_pistomp.txt` for Pi 3/4/5, so `/dev/ttyAMA0` always exists |
| wifi-check | ✓ | ✓ | Both enable wifi-check; Arch also enables wifi-hotspot (redundant) |

### Remaining service file differences

Most service files now match Arch. One intentional divergence:

**`jack.service`** — Debian uses `After=firstboot.service` (correct; ensures
JACK config exists before JACK starts). Arch uses `After=sound.target`. Debian
is better here: JACK can never start before `/etc/default/jack` exists.

All four services (`jack`, `mod-host`, `mod-ala-pi-stomp`, `mod-ui`) now wire
`lcd-splash` as `ExecStartPre` matching Arch. `jack.service` uses the `-+`
prefix (run as root) because the `jack` user is not in the `gpio` group;
the others run as `pistomp` which is.

**`mod-ui.service`** — Debian carries a few extra `MOD_*` env vars
(`MOD_APP`, `MOD_LIVE_ISO`, `MOD_SYSTEM_OUTPUT`) that Arch omits; these are
harmless defaults.

---

## Networking

Both match on: NM keyfile plugin, `dns=dnsmasq`, wifi power-save off, MAC
randomization off, wired DHCP → link-local fallback, multihome policy-routing
dispatcher, `wifi-check.service` (proper `After=NetworkManager-wait-online.service`,
not a blind sleep), `libnss-mdns` + `nsswitch.conf` `mdns_minimal` for
`pistomp.local` resolution.

### Debian-specific: dnsmasq service masking

Both builds use `dns=dnsmasq` in `NetworkManager.conf`, which lets NM manage
its own dnsmasq instance for DNS/mDNS. On Arch, the system dnsmasq service
never auto-starts (Arch requires explicit `systemctl enable`), so there is no
conflict. On Debian, installing the `dnsmasq` package auto-starts the service
via package postinst, which binds port 53 before NM can — breaking NM's
dnsmasq plugin entirely and preventing eth0 from getting any address (including
link-local). `03-run.sh` masks `dnsmasq.service` at image-build time to prevent
this. NM's hotspot (`ipv4.method shared`) uses its own internal dnsmasq instance
and is unaffected.

### Debian-specific: explicit service enables

Arch enables NM via `ln -sf` into `multi-user.target.wants/`. On Debian,
`network-manager` postinst uses `deb-systemd-helper`, which is unreliable inside
pi-gen's intercepted-systemctl chroot. `03-run.sh` calls `systemctl enable
NetworkManager.service` and `systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service` explicitly.

### mDNS

Arch installs `nss-mdns` and configures `nsswitch.conf` in `02-system.sh`.
Debian installs `libnss-mdns` (in `01-sys-tweaks/00-packages`) and sets the
same `hosts:` line via `sed` in `03-run.sh`. `avahi-daemon` is auto-started
by Debian's package postinst, but is also explicitly enabled for belt-and-suspenders.

### SSH access hardening

`03-run.sh` explicitly sets `PasswordAuthentication yes` in `sshd_config` so
the device is reachable via `pistomp`/`pistomp` even before `firstboot.sh` has
run (i.e. before the user's `SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEY` from `pistomp.conf` is written
to `authorized_keys`). Arch sets the same flag in `02-system.sh`.

### Wired interface name

Wired NM profile uses **`eth0`** here and **`end0`** in Arch. RasPiOS sets
`net.ifnames=0` (classic names); Arch uses predictable names. Both are correct
for their platform.

## Kernel

| | Debian | Arch |
|---|---|---|
| Source | Raspberry Pi Linux (pinned commit in config.sh) | Arch ARM linux-rpi PKGBUILD base (pinned commit) |
| diffconfig | ~100 lines (RT + size optimisations, disables XFS/BTRFS/GPU/InfiniBand/ISDN/PCI-audio/staging) | ~400 lines (Arch ARM baseline + RT additions) |
| Build method | Cross-compile x86_64 → arm64 (`bindeb-pkg`) | Native aarch64 (`makepkg`) |
| Output | `.deb` files in `cache/kernel/` | `.pkg.tar.*` files in `cache/` |
| Arch extra patches | — | `disable-heavy-features.patch`, `0001-Make-proc-cpuinfo-consistent-on-arm64-and-arm.patch` |

The Debian diffconfig explicitly disables GPU drivers (amdgpu, i915, nouveau,
radeon, xe, vmwgfx), InfiniBand, ISDN, PCI sound, and staging at compile
time. Arch disables overlapping sets at compile time and then prunes the
remaining module directories at image-build time (09-cleanup.sh). The Debian
approach is cleaner: nothing to prune because the modules are never built.

---

## Cleanup

| | Debian | Arch |
|---|---|---|
| Build toolchain | Kept (part of base OS) | Removed (`base-devel`, gcc, kernel headers) |
| Kernel module pruning | Not needed — disabled in diffconfig | Explicit runtime removal |
| Firmware pruning | Minimal | Keeps only brcm/cypress (RPi WiFi/BT) |
| Zero-fill before compression | ✓ (`dd if=/dev/zero` in stage3/02-cleanup) | ✓ (09-cleanup.sh) |
| SBOM | syft generates SBOM on export | Not generated |

## Open items

- **Global pip3 installs** — `stage2/04-python/01-run.sh` installs packages
  system-wide for services that use `--system-site-packages` venvs (browsepy,
  touchosc2midi). Arch isolates everything to venvs. The current set
  (`flask`, `unicategories`, `netifaces2`, `mido`, `docopt`, `python-rtmidi`)
  is the minimal correct list; packages already covered by uv venvs have been
  removed. Fully eliminating global installs would require giving browsepy and
  touchosc2midi self-contained venvs.
- **`/usr/lib/lv2` absent from `LV2_PATH`** — Arch includes `:/usr/lib/lv2`
  in jack/mod-host/mod-ui service environments; Debian only exports
  `/home/pistomp/.lv2`. No packages in this build install plugins to
  `/usr/lib/lv2` today, so this has no runtime effect. Add it if apt-installed
  LV2 plugin packages are ever added.
- **jackbridge** — present as a `.deb` here and in Arch (installed via
  `install.sh`). On-demand only; not auto-started. Kept.
- **eth0 vs end0** — Resolved. `EthernetManager.iface` is now a `@cached_property`
  that discovers the first wired non-loopback interface from `/sys/class/net/`
  at runtime, so pi-stomp works on both `eth0` (Debian) and `end0` (Arch) without
  hardcoding.
- **firstboot.sh robustness** — `set -e` is active throughout firstboot. Calls
  to `modify_version.sh` and `pi5_eeprom_update.sh` use `|| true` so a failure
  there does not skip the final `reboot -f`. Any new command added to firstboot
  that is non-fatal should also use `|| true`.
- **Unpinned upstream refs** — `HYLIA_REF`, `AMIDITHRU_REF`,
  `TOUCHOSC2MIDI_REF`, `MOD_MIDI_MERGER_REF`, `MOD_TTYMIDI_REF`, and
  `JACKROUTER_REF` in `config.sh` are all `master` with no commit hash. Pin
  them if a build breaks.
- **mod-ui uv.lock** — see mod-ui section above.
